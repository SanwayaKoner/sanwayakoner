# Sanwaya Koner's Portfolio
### About
Hello and welcome! I'm Sanwaya Koner, a passionate mathematician weaving stories with numbers. Armed with a Master's in Mathematics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, and a Bachelor's from the University of Calcutta, I've translated messy data into compelling narratives.

Currently immersed in a project exploring mixed-effects regression models, I aim to decode the dynamics of longitudinal data. By employing statistical modeling techniques, I seek to unveil intricate relationships and tackle real-world challenges.

In my professional journey, I embarked on a transformative research internship at the Indian Statistical Institute-Delhi Centre, delving into Matrix Analysis under Dr. Tanvi Jain's guidance. Beyond academics, I actively contribute as a volunteer at Rahara 88 Degree East Foundation, embodying altruism in community-driven initiatives. Join me on this voyage through my portfolio, where every project unfolds a unique narrative. Together, let's navigate the realms of mathematics and data analytics, shaping meaningful insights and success stories!

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

  
### Hospitality Project
